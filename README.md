# You Have Upset Jareth

I prototyped this a long time ago, but found a copy on an old hard disc and decided to preserve it on github.com. It was designed as an incredibly dumb, and now (thanks to XSS protection) 
defunct Javascript Bookmarklet that could be run on a web page and obscure any use of the C-word with the photo of an irate Jareth.

## But Why?

It was inspired by this little bit from Adam Buxton's "Bug" program:

Blame him, I guess.
